Hi, free Human!

We are very appreciate and wellcome people, who understand the importance of simplifying solutions in react state management and glad to see you participation!

In general, the stels community is an association of people for whom freedom can be expressed only in absolute independence and the absence of the need to follow strict instructions. Our rules exist only for one purpose - to prevent some free people from violating the freedom of others, in other words, they are needed only for our compatibility with each other and ensuring productive cooperation.
